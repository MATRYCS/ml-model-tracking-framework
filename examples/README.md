# ML Model Tracking Framework examples

- The `push_dummy_model.py` script pushes a dummy model into MLFlow and registers it as **matrycs-dummy-regressor**.
- The `list_dummy_model.py` script lists all registered models in the MLFlow instance.
- The `pull_dummy_model.py` script pulls the latest dummy model marked as **production**, feeds it with input data, and prints the output.
